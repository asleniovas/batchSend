# batchSend
<b>Excel macro for sending lots of emails</b>

Simple VBA script to send emails based on what information is given in your active spreadsheet. I have included a TestBook with the code module if you want to take it for a quick spin.

Open `TestBook.xlsm` navigate to the `Developer` tab, select `Macros` in the top left corner and click `Run`. Remember to have Outlook on your PC.

This is the first program I ever wrote a couple of years ago. I know there are millions of tools for sending out batches of emails and this is nothing special, however I found it very useful when I worked in sales and had to send out a ton of personalised advertising emails to my clients.

Microsoft have great docs on how to utilise VBA for various automation tasks: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/outlook
